The goal of the [Clippy: smart PDF reader for better paper reading experience and knowledge mining](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2023/icse-2023-score-2023#clippy:-smart-pdf-reader-for-better-paper-reading-experience-and-knowledge-mining) project was to make a smart PDF reader for scientific papers that makes research easier and more efficient. The project was restricted to using GitHub for source code versioning and MIT-licensed libraries. All the functionalities are built upon the mandatory PDF.js library.

The result of the Clippy project should be a PDF reader that should help the researcher to parse and extract information from the paper such as tables, figures, and equations. Clippy should also build a knowledge graph out of all the references from the paper showing which papers are connected to each other. To get a quick overview of the paper Clippy should also generate a summary of the paper. All of the requirements are intended to be able to go quickly through a paper without the need to read all of it.

Initial requirements from project sponsors were:

-   resolving and presenting cross-references inside a paper
-   building a knowledge graph for the references of a paper
-   generating/mining summarizations for key components of the paper
-   (optionally) highlighting commonly used, topic-specific phrasings

Technologies used in making Clippy are:

-   Node.js -- bakcend
-   Javascript + JQuery - frontend
